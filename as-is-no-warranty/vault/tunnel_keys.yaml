# Tunnel keys are separated from other 'keys' vault file
# simply because of the volume of VPN tunnels alone.
# Also VPN tunnels changed more often than other parts of the config.

#
# AWS VPC is usually connected with a pair of redundant VPN tunnels.
# Shared keys are coming from AWS, we just store them to produce
# our side of VPN tunnel configuration using Ansible
#
aws_keys:
  # sc-gre-1 router

  '9d2d1be9-1': 'bbbb'  # Tu2 (backup for Tu1)
  '05712340-0': 'cccc'  # Tu3
  '05712340-1': 'dddd'  # Tu4 (backup for Tu3)

# OpenTable VPN tunnels (IntraNet)
# Two keys - one for IPSEC IKE, and other one for OSPF per tunnel
# Will use encrypted version of secrets when available
