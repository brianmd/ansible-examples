# BGP keys names contain side_a and side_z routers hostnames separated by '/'
# clear text version of the secret is used only if encrypted version for the same
# secret is not found per dev_os (ios, in this case).
# Using encrypted versions of shared secrets make the final IOS config 
# more stable between Ansible runs. If kept unencrypted version, Cisco router
# would re-encrypt it differently every time you generate config with Ansible,
# so there diff will not be empty from original IOS config...

# OSPF secrets are defined per subnet (or segment).
