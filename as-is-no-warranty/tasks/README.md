### Welcome to collection of tasks (parts of different roles)

__napalm_show_diff.yaml__ is small, but very useful task. It allows us to stage a new version of JunOS config to the Juniper device and compare it to the running config. The "diff" will be returned and displayed at Ansible console for network engineer to review and decide whether to continue or abort.
