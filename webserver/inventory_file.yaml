# This is the example of the "source of truth" file
# you may maintain for all network devices (or other hosts too).
# Its format is very flexible - each host entry may contain any
# number of attributes.
# But to make use of that flexibility one needs to parse that
# source of truth file and create reasonable 'groups' that will
# contain the list of hostnames that belong to such a group.
# The easiest implementation is available as part of this demo:
# it simply scans through all attributes ever mentioned under any host,
# and it makes a list of all unique values of those attributes.
# Then that list of unique values of all attributes becomes the list
# of groups for Ansible dynamic inventory.
# Note. That is oversimplified approach, but it might work for one
# who does not have large inventory, nor large number of attributes,
# nor overlapping values for different attributes.
# This is demo only. Please develop your own logic for making dynamic
# groups for Ansible inventory based on attributes your hosts have.

host1:
  os: junos
  loc: sf
host2:
  os: ios
  loc: sf
host3:
  os: junos
  loc: sc
host4:
  my_new_attr: foobar # 'foobar' will appear as a group name in Ansible inventory
